## Why
[Heirline](https://github.com/rebelot/heirline.nvim) is a engine to create your own Neovim user interface. This comes at a price though: increased complexity. To avoid that problem, I've decided to compile this collection of components you can fork and modify. That way you have a safe and well tested starting point to hopefuly save you a lot of time.

## How to install
Add it as a dependency of heirline

```lua
{
  "rebelot/heirline.nvim",
  dependencies = { "Zeioth/heirline-components.nvim" },
  opts = {},
    config = function(_, opts)
      local heirline = require "heirline"
      local heirline_components = require "heirline-components.all"

      -- Setup
      heirline_components.init.subscribe_to_events()
      heirline.load_colors(heirline_components.hl.get_colors())
      heirline.setup(opts)
    end,
}
```

## Heirline-componenets options
You can customize icons and colors in a easy way.

| Option |

| [icons](https://github.com/Zeioth/heirline-components.nvim/wiki/icons) |
| [colors](https://github.com/Zeioth/heirline-components.nvim/wiki/colors) |

For example:
```lua
"rebelot/heirline.nvim",
dependencies = {
  {
    "Zeioth/heirline-components.nvim",
    opts = {
      icons = { DiagnosticError = ";D" }
      colors = nil
    }
  }
}
```

## Example config
You can find the example config we use for NormalNvim [here](https://github.com/NormalNvim/NormalNvim/blob/98be877c6bac59dff495f5c6aabe4e20832bdb90/lua/plugins/2-ui.lua#L282).

## Credits
Currently, most of the GPL3 lua components this plugin use come from AstroNvim and NormalNvim. So please support both projects if you enjoy this plugin.

## FAQ
* **How can I contribute with a component?** Clone this repo. Go to [core.component.lua](https://github.com/Zeioth/heirline-components.nvim/blob/main/lua/heirline-components/core/component.lua) and create yours there. Then open a PR.
* **How do components work?** A component is made of providers. So you can use providers to build your component. Aditionally, conditions are used to decide when a component should be displayed. These components have been tested on nvim `v0.9.x`
* **How can I avoid breaking changes?** Always use the components by importing `heirline-components.all`. That way internal changes won't affect you. If you wanna be extra sure, you can also lock the plugin version in your package manager to avoid getting updates.

## Roadmap
* We are in process of documenting the components in the wiki and readme, this should take a few days, so please be patient.
* Since we are giving users the ability to customize icons, we should remove the icons we are not actually using, to make it less confusing.
