dependencies = {
  {

## Credits
Currently, most of the GPL3 lua components this plugin use come from AstroNvim and NormalNvim. So please support both projects if you enjoy this plugin.

## FAQ
* **How can I contribute with a component?** Clone this repo. Go to [core.component.lua](https://github.com/Zeioth/heirline-components.nvim/blob/main/lua/heirline-components/core/component.lua) and create yours there. Then open a PR.
* **How do components work?** A component is made of providers. So you can use providers to build your component. Aditionally, conditions are used to decide when a component should be displayed.
* **What nvim version do I need?** These components have been tested on nvim `v0.9.x`
* **How can I avoid breaking changes?** Always use the components by importing `heirline-components.all`. That way internal changes won't affect you. If you wanna be extra sure, you can also lock the plugin version in your package manager to avoid getting updates.
* **Icons look weird:** Make sure you are using nerd fonts. Otherwise you can set the option `icons` to pass a table with your own icons. Chech [here](https://github.com/Zeioth/heirline-components.nvim/blob/main/lua/heirline-components/config.lua).
* **I've found a bug!** Please [report it](https://github.com/Zeioth/heirline-components.nvim/issues) so I can fix it, and make sure you send a screenshot.

## Roadmap
* ~~wip for `v0.3.0`: new component `tabline_buffers` so we can use it directly.~~
* wip `v0.3.0`: new option `opts.colors` to pass the colors used by the components.
* idea: Maybe there is some way we can automatically do the things we are currently doing in `config` in lazy, so users can further simplify their configs.
* idea: Consider making every component a different file. â†’ Every file is loaded by core.component so we don't get breaking changes.
* idea: Consider adding hyperlinks to the readme, so users can quickly navigate the code of every component, as we did in compiler.nivm â†’ This should greatly increate user participation.
