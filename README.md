# heirline-components.nvim
Distro agnostic components you can use in your Neovim heirline config.

## Available components
WIP: Please be patient.

## Roadmap
* Cleanup utils → Delete functions that are not used in the code from `init.lua` and `buffer.lua`.
* Refactor → Let's try to organize the code in a more semantically meaningful way.
* In the compiler.nvim component (which we may rebrand, or copy as overseer component), try to remove the condition that prevents overseer from displaying a error on new buffers. They might have fixed that.
