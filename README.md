# heirline-components.nvim
Distro agnostic components you can use in your Neovim heirline config.

## Roadmap
* Moving statusbar components.
* In the compiler.nvim component (which we may rebrand, or copy as overseer component), try to remove the condition that prevents overseer from displaying a error on new buffers. They might have fixed that.
